### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab two part one is definitely my favorite lab out of all the labs I have accomplished.  It is the beginning of my journey as a computer science major, and is the foundation of what I worked on throughout the course.  This lab is extremely easy, yet it taught me the joy of learning such a simple concept and actually seeing it work.

* Lab 5

    Lab five part three was one of my favorite labs because it was the first project that I experienced a difficult error.  In this lab, I was working alongside my partner and we were having difficulties trying to figure out why it is giving us logic errors.  It was through this that I realized how passionate I am in computer science and how driven I am to solve problems even if it takes hours of my time.

* Lab 12

    Lab twelve part one is about creating an animation.  It is one of my favorite labs because it taught me how far I have come from knowing nothing in C++ to actually creating a gif from a set of colors.  It made me realize how much I've accomplished from the course of three months.
